Comrades: Mobile App for Tabletop Roleplaying Gamers

Comrades, a mobile app concept that connects local tabletop roleplaying game (TRPG) players through shared interests, is the result of a semester-long project for my Interaction Design course. The project challenged me to select a local community, identify a problem or challenge being faced by that community, and develop a solution. For this project, I focused on the local tabletop roleplaying game (TRPG) community. TRPGs are highly social, interactive experiences that are typically played in-person using books, maps, dice and other resources to build engaging worlds and stories for the players to interact with (e.g. Dungeons and Dragons, Shadowrun, Pathfinder, etc.)

Problem Statement
TRPGs are inherently social and rely heavily on a shared, safe social dynamic between the players. New players or players who have recently relocated lack the social connections to find players in their area who share the same interests and values. I used competitive analysis and user interviews to identify what current platforms were already being used and what they did and didn’t do well. I identified that players struggled making meaningful connections because existing platforms distilled player’s interests down to a specific game, instead of considering the needs and interests of the player overall.

Design Process and Philosophy
I approached this project focusing on participatory and reflective design approaches with a focus on what biases exist in the space currently and how those might be overcome. My design philosophy centered on promoting face-to-face interaction, informing the user about the recommendations being presented to them, and empowering the user to maintain control over their information.

I began the design process by creating sketches and storyboards of potential high- and low-tech solutions. Presenting them to new and experienced players helped narrow down what solutions addressed the problem and which ones they were likely to use. After identifying a mobile app as the solution to move forward with, I used paper prototypes to test features and functionality with potential users and iterate multiple times before arriving at the final feature set. The high-fidelity prototype iterations identified what interactions and conventions were best for this type of solution.

Features and Functions
My app focuses on doing a small number of features well in order to address the overarching problem. In the final prototype the app focuses on the following features:

Provide users with information about players in their area with the option to filter or show more detail about a specific user
Recommend players based on user-submitted interests and personality traits and inform users why these players were recommended
Provide a safe, anonymous communication method within the app in order to connect with other users
Help users provide useful information through carefully worded questions that help new and experienced users make meaningful matches
