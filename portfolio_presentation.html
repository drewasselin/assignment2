CASE District 1 Conference 2017 | January 26, 2017
Co-Presenter: Jennifer Doak-Mathewson
Part of a 3-group conference panel on website redesigns, my colleague and I discussed how we approached a large web project with only 2 dedicated staff members and a $10,000 budget.
We shared our project constraints, timeline, and results but focused mostly on the key concepts that small or large teams can use during a redesign: Technical and Content audits, Expert and Stakeholder Interviews, and Expectation and Project Management.

Technical aspects of web redesign are not talked about as much in the higher education community. This was a great opportunity to teach practitioners about low-cost methods to help development and to teach non-practitioners about how they can help their colleagues succeed in future projects.
