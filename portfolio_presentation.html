    <h1>Presentation: How Small Shops Can Tackle Big Redesigns</h1>

      <p>
        CASE District 1 Conference 2017 | January 26, 2017<br>
        Co-Presenter: Jennifer Doak-Mathewson<br>
      </p>
      <p>
        Part of a 3-group conference panel on website redesigns, my colleague and I discussed how we approached a large web project with only 2 dedicated staff members and a $10,000 budget.
        We shared our project constraints, timeline, and results but focused mostly on the key concepts that small or large teams can use during a redesign: Technical and Content audits, Expert and Stakeholder Interviews, and Expectation and Project Management.
      </p>
      <p>
        Technical aspects of web redesign are not talked about as much in the higher education community. This was a great opportunity to teach practitioners about low-cost methods to help development and to teach non-practitioners about how they can help their colleagues succeed in future projects.
