      <h1> Hi, I’m Drew! </h1>

      <p>I’m a graduate student at the University of Michigan studying Interaction Design and User Experience Design. I’m not your usual UX professional: I’ve worked in client management, web development, design, IT, and digital marketing. Each step in my career has taught me valuable skills in how to understand users, their circumstances, and their needs. These experiences help me approach each project with empathy, curiosity, and an open mind.</p>

      <p>When I’m not working I enjoy video games, tabletop role playing games, spoiling my two tortie cats, and trying to keep up with the newest Japanese shows.</p>
